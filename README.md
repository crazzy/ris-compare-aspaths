# RIPE RIS Compare AS-path

This is a small tool to compare the AS-paths of a previous set of RIPE RIS data to the current state, which can be used to detect changes in peering relations on the path to the target.

Feel free to use this however you like, contributions are very welcome as well even though I mainly created this for my own use.
